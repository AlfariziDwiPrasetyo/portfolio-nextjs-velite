        Hey there, I'm Tiyo, a tech-savvy dude with a love for programming,
        coffee, and music. When I'm not busy coding, you can catch me cheering
        for Manchester United, though it's often a frustrating experience,
        wkwkw. Still, my loyalty never wavers. And yes, coffee and coding are
        inseparable for meâ€”nothing beats the rush of caffeine-fueled
        productivity! But it's not all about work for me, as I also enjoy losing
        myself in good tunes and good tv series.
