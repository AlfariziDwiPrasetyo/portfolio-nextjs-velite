# Node Modules Cleaner (nmcleaner)

`nmcleaner` is a simple command-line tool that helps you clean up all `node_modules` directories recursively in a given project directory. It provides options to perform a dry run (just printing the directories without deleting them) and to force deletion even if there are permission errors.

## Installation

To install `nmcleaner`, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh) as your package manager:

1. Make sure you have Bun installed. If you don't, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Bun website](https://bun.sh/).

2. Clone or download the repository.

3. Inside the repository, run the following command to make the script executable :

```bash
bun install # to install the dependencies

bun link # to link a local package.

# start to use the tools
nmcleaner ./test/ --dry-run --force
```

### Arguments

- `[target]`: The target directory where the cleanup should start. If not provided, it defaults to the current directory (`.`).

### Options

- `--dry-run`: Runs the tool in dry-run mode. It will print the directories that would be deleted without actually removing anything.  
- `-f, --force`: Forces the deletion of `node_modules` directories, even if there are permission errors.

### Example Commands

1. Clean the current directory (with `node_modules` removed recursively).
2. Clean a specific directory (e.g., `./project`).
3. Dry run (print the directories that would be deleted without actually deleting them).
4. Force deletion (ignore permission errors and force delete).

``` bash
nmcleaner ./test/ --dry-run --force
```
