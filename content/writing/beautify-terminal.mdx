## Prerequisites 
- You need the Kitty terminal (optional actually), you can check the Kitty docs for how to install it in your device [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).
- Check your shell by writing this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    echo $0
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    echo $SHELL
    ```

## Download and install Nerd fonts
Download and install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) in your terminal. Here's how you install fonts in Kitty:
    1. Unzip the file.
    2. Move your `.ttf` files to `~/.local/share/fonts` (create this directory if it doesn’t exist).
    3. Type `fc-cache -f -v` to refresh the font cache.
    4. Open Kitty's configuration file:
        ```bash
        nano ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
        ```
        or use VSCode if you prefer:
        ```bash
        code ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
        ```
    5. Add the following line to set the fonts (for example, if you're using MesloLGS NF)
        ```conf
        font_family MesloLGS NF
        ```



## Install Starship Prompt
After setting up the fonts and terminal, the next step is to install the **Starship** prompt.

1. Install Starship by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
    ```

2. Add the following line to your shell configuration file depending on the shell you use:

    - For **Bash**, add this to `~/.bashrc`:
    ```bash
    eval "$(starship init bash)"
    ```

    - For **Zsh**, add this to `~/.zshrc`:
    ```bash
    eval "$(starship init zsh)"
    ```

3. Restart your terminal or source the configuration file:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # For Bash
    source ~/.zshrc   # For Zsh
    ```




## Customize Starship Configuration
Starship’s configuration is stored in a file located at `~/.config/starship.toml`. Here's how you can create and modify it:

1. Create the configuration file:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config && touch ~/.config/starship.toml
    ```

2. Open the file in an editor like Nano or VSCode:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.config/starship.toml
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    code ~/.config/starship.toml
    ```

3. Add some basic configurations. For example:

    ```toml
    [prompt]
    # Change the prompt symbol
    symbol = "❯"

    [character]
    success_symbol = "[✔](bold green)"
    error_symbol = "[✘](bold red)"

    [battery]
    # Display battery status only when charging or discharging
    display = "auto"
    ```

## Test Your Terminal
Now that everything is set up, open a new terminal window and check the new prompt, fonts, and symbols. 

If you want to further tweak the appearance, explore more advanced Starship configurations in the [official Starship documentation](https://starship.rs/config/).

also if you are lazy to tweak by yourself there is a preset that starship already create [here](https://starship.rs/presets/)


## The Config im using
<Image src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1H-PL_2yVVx-LO1-r5H2X5X5w8gml5iAH" width={600} height={600} />

First you need to install the catpuccin-mocha theme for kitty [here](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty)

then type this command ``starship preset gruvbox-rainbow -o ~/.config/starship.toml``

and last copy [this](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/dotfiles/blob/master/starship/.config/starship.toml) config and paste it to your ``starship.toml`` to apply it
