##  Summer Berry Cobbler with a Twist  ##

This recipe takes a classic summer dessert – berry cobbler – and adds a delightful twist with a hint of citrus and a buttery oat crumble topping. 

### Ingredients: ###

* 4 cups fresh mixed berries (such as blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, or blackberries)
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup rolled oats
* 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* Pinch of salt

### Instructions: ###

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. In a large bowl, combine berries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and orange zest. Toss gently to coat. 
3. Pour the berry mixture into the prepared baking dish.
4. In a separate bowl, using a pastry cutter or your fingers, combine flour, rolled oats, cold butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt until a crumbly mixture forms.
5. Sprinkle the oat crumble topping evenly over the berry mixture.
6. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crumble topping is golden brown.
7. Let cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream (optional).

### Tips: ###

* You can substitute frozen berries for fresh berries in this recipe. If using frozen, do not thaw them beforehand, as excess moisture can affect the texture of the cobbler.
* For a richer flavor, use a mixture of white and brown sugar in the crumble topping.
* Feel free to experiment with different spices in the crumble topping, such as nutmeg, cardamom, or ginger.


This recipe is sure to become a summer favorite!
