### Crunch the Numbers: A JavaScript Calculator

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through constructing a user-friendly calculator using JavaScript. This hands-on approach will solidify your understanding of variables, operators, and DOM manipulation.

### Gathering the Supplies

Before we begin coding, let's identify the essential elements:

1. **HTML Structure:** We'll create a basic HTML structure to house our calculator's buttons and display.
2. **JavaScript Functionality:** The JavaScript code will handle user interactions, calculations, and updating the display.
3. **CSS Styling (Optional):** You can incorporate CSS to enhance the calculator's visual appeal (not covered in this tutorial).

### Building the Foundation (HTML)

Here's a fundamental HTML structure for our calculator:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Calculator</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Simple Calculator</h1>
  <div id="display"></div>
  <button onclick="appendNumber('1')">1</button>
  <button onclick="appendNumber('2')">2</button>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a basic webpage with a heading, a display element `(div with id "display")`, and some buttons. The script tag references an external JavaScript fil `(script.js)` where our logic resides.

### Scripting the Logic (JavaScript)
Now, let's dive into the JavaScript code (script.js) that brings the calculator to life:

```js
let currentNumber = "";
let previousNumber = "";
let operation = "";

function appendNumber(number) {
  currentNumber += number;
  document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = currentNumber;
}

function clearDisplay() {
  currentNumber = "";
  previousNumber = "";
  operation = "";
  document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "";
}

// Functions for handling operations (+, -, *, /) would go here

function calculate() {
  // Implement calculation logic based on operation
  // Update display with the result
}
```

This script incorporates variables to store current and previous numbers, along with the selected operation. Functions handle various actions:

- `appendNumber`: Appends a clicked digit to the current number and updates the display.
- `clearDisplay`: Clears the display and resets all calculator variables.

Placeholder comments indicate where functions for handling operations `(+, -, *, /)` would be implemented. The `calculate` function would utilize the stored numbers and operation to perform the calculation and update the display with the result.

This is a starting point for your JavaScript calculator. You can extend it by adding functionalities for various mathematical operations, decimal points, and error handling. Remember to implement the operation functions and incorporate them into the button click events!
